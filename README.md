# othello-game

This programming was to design Othello game (aka. Reversi)
that has two players who play either black or white dics.

It collects players' information: name, desired color(black or white) or symbol(X for black, O for white) 
It asks players to identify who is going first and desired board size.


Players can play each turn.
Players can place their discs on desired position
by typing letters indicate the position (i.e. AC : A-rows & C-columns) 

Movement should be valid:
  Players should place their disc on an empty cell; and
  the dics should flip other player's disc
  
When flip occurs, the symbol changes ( O -> X or X -> O )

When the game finishes, it shows who won and scores.
